# The video datasets: http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/SpaceTimeActions.html <br>
# This repository represents a simple way to extract motions from video's frames, all the videos have static background <br>
# For videos with dynamic background, for example: Wave surfing, it is better to use morphological erosion to get rid of those noisy motions in the background
